/**
 * Demonstrates :
 * - passing arrays into functions
 * - using pointers to access arrays passed into functions
 *
 * When an array is passed to a function, what is actually passed is
 * the ADDRESS of the first element of the array.
 * If we pass an address into a function as an argument, then a pointer parameter
 * (or an array parameter) must be defined in the function header to accept the address.
 *
 * When the address of an object (or array) is passed into a function,
 * the code in the function has access to the object that the pointer is pointing at,
 * and may access and/or change its value.

//******************************* Exercise *******************************************

//TODO  Q.1.
// Declare two arrays of type int, each of length 5, in main() called y[] and z[]
// Populate the array y[] with five values.
// Write a function called copy() that will accept two array arguments, y and z,
//  - both of type 'pointer to int' -
// and will copy the contents of one array y(source) to the other array  z (target)
// using POINTER NOTATION.
// In main(), output z[] to confirm that your function has worked.
// You will need to pass in the length of the source array.
// Here is the function prototype:
//    void copy(int* pTarget, int* pSource, int length)


//
//TODO Q.3
// Write a function pallindrome() that will accept an array of int
// and will output the elements in order, directly followed by the
// elements in reverse order to give a pallindrome effect.
// Use POINTER NOTATION in the function.
// e.g. if we use x[] from above, the output should be:
//          10,20,30,40,40,30,20,10
